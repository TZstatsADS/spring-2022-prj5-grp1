# Project 5: Tree Classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, HistGradient Boosting, XGBoosting)

+ Project summary: In this project, we created a Weekly Supervised Learning model. On creating an inital Neural Network model, we trained the data on the noisy dataset and tried to get predictions for a few. Using these predicted values, we updated our data to insert it into Model 2, where we managed to increase the accuracy subsequently as compared to our initial model.
